# Encounter Changes

---

## Overview

1. This document covers any changes made to the Gift Pokémon you receive as well as any static encounters within the game e.g. the Kecleon you encounter throughout the game, many legendary Pokémon and even the Wild Pokémon you encounter when Soaring in the Sky.

2. To see these changes, you need to include the DllField.cro file when building your game. However you will only be able to actually use these changes if you're playing with a method that is able to 'patch the RO module', else your game will crash upon trying to launch it. This means for Gateway and HANS users you can't use these changes, but Luma3DS or Citra users should be able to include it with no problems whatsoever.
