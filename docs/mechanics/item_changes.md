# Item Changes

---

## Overview

1. This document covers any changes made to items such as usability or price, as well as changes to what the PokéMarts and markets around Hoenn are selling.

2. The changes to PokéMarts are key to evolving many of the new Pokémon you can get as they will sell you evolution stones and items. You need to use the code.bin file in the exeFS and if not using HANS, also make sure no OR/AS patches from the eshop are installed to see these mart changes. (The same also applies to text edits but those aren't as important.)

3. PokéMarts also sell a few Mega Stones for a hefty price that you weren't able to get before defeating the Elite Four in OR/AS. This includes every Mega Stone with the exception of Salamencite and Diancite, which can be found as held items on Shelgon or Salamence and Diancie respectively.

## Market Changes

A lot of the shops have been changed around the Hoenn region, now selling you a mixture of evolution items, mega stones and some TMs. The inventories for these shops is listed below.

Due to limited space, you cannot buy vitamins or X items anymore. Vitamins can be found from the Battle Resort stalls, but X items that you don't find on the floor are no longer available. Sorry about that!
