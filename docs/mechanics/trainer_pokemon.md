# Trainer Pokémon

---

## Overview

1. The trainers for each route are also listed, with their Pokémon and accompanying levels shown. For special trainers such as Gym Leaders and the Elite Four, an extra section is shown with their Pokémon in higher detail, including abilities, held items and movesets. Some of these trainers do have new moves that are obtainable outside of this hack; an alternate trainer file is offered where these moves are replaced with legal options.

2. Trainer rematches are also shown for each route under a rematch column. The number next to their names refers to how many badges you need to obtain to unlock that trainer roster, e.g. a (2) means they'll start using those Pokémon if you rematch them after obtaining the Balance Badge in Dewford. (C) refers to champion and will be their team after clearing the Pokémon League the first time around.

3. One last thing to note is that the trainer levels throughout the game have been designed assuming you have a full team of six Pokémon and YOU ARE NOT USING THE EXP. SHARE. You still gain the Exp. Share in Petalburg Woods and it's set to on by default, so remember to toggle that unless you happen to be training an entire team of slow levelers or something.
