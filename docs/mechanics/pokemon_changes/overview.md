# Overview

---

1. In this document you'll find any changes made to the abilities, types, stats, held items, TM/HM compatibility, evolution method and level up moves to any individual Pokémon.

2. Level up moves are listed for every Pokémon, regardless of whether they've been changed or not. However, a large majority are edited, usually taking the approach of rearranging the level up order to make them more accessible to use by bringing important moves earlier or shrinking gaps between level up moves (think of how Eevee and its evolutions had their level up moves changed in B2/W2).

3. Most Pokémon have also been given additional moves in their level up pools; some of these are egg moves, move tutor or TM/HM moves that they can learn normally anyway, but can be hard to access in the context of the main game of OR/AS. There are some Pokémon that have also been given entirely new moves, abilities or TMs to play with (e.g. Megahorn Beedrill, Hurricane Sigilyph).

4. You can identify these new (and thus illegal in the usual games) additions by the asterisk system.

	- No asterisk means the Pokémon always can learn this move by level up, have this ability etc but it may be at a different level, be a hidden ability etc.

	- One asterisk (*) means the Pokémon is able to learn this move but not ordinarily by level up, and is most likely pulled from egg moves, TMs/HMs or move tutors. These moves are available in the full version as well as the legal only one.

	- Two asterisks (**) means the Pokémon is unable to obtain this ability or move ordinarily, and is completely illegal outside of the context of this hack. The legal moves only version of the a/1/9/1 GARC file omits all of these moves. Levels may be adjusted to fill the gap left by a removed move but are not documented. There are two specific cases that are documented with what they've changed into.

5. Additionally, a location on where to obtain a Pokémon (or what to evolve if not) is listed for each species, though you'll want to check out the wild document for more context.
