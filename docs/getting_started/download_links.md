The files for Rising Ruby and Sinking Sapphire can be found in [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-zmEVN0Mas6b3p1cUg3UVNXNWM?resourcekey=0-LpcfVeyFYbeRwAj1c9AV2A){:target="\_blank"}. Basic instructions are given as to how to play the game in the Readme file. It is suggested to use arm9loaderhax and Luma3DS with a CIA installation to get the best experience. Failing that, use HANS via the Homebrew Channel. A Gateway cart can be used but I would recommend against it unless you already own one and are feeling lazy.

There is a plan to offer modified versions of some of the files with the new illegal stuff (new moves, base stat changes etc) ripped out but the more legit stuff like held item changes and level up moves from alternate legal sources left in. These aren't available yet unfortunately, but you can pick and choose which GARC files you'd like to bring in.
